# unzipper

## Description

Unzips *all* zip files in the directory you run it from. It just works right out of the box, no frills or complicated stuff.

**Beware:** When it unzips, it will overwrite existing directories with the same names as the zip files. **You can avoid disaster by renaming your zip files with unique names.**
